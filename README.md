# Welcome to <%= Recipe Search %>
I undertook the Introduction to Python Programmin course run by Code First Girls during summer 2021. A mini project was the final assigment and after I finished the course I decided to keep working on it adding new features, refactoring the code and adding tests.

## Recipe Search
 Recipe Search it is a program to search for recipes based on an ingredient. The  project uses the Edamam Recipe API and allows you to filter the recipes by meal type, sort the results by calories or alphabetically and save the search in a csv file.

## This project requires the following:
-csv module
-pytest framework
-requests (HTTP library)
-tabulate
-pandas
